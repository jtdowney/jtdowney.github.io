      <p>We&rsquo;ve all seen the tense scene in a war movie where the order has come down to launch the nuclear missiles. The captain and his first officer each take out a special key they&rsquo;ve had around their neck the whole time. Then they both insert their individual keys into the weapons computer and turn simultaneously. Despite being a popular motif, this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_man_rule">real policy</a> implemented by many military organizations, including the U.S. Air Force. Once you think about it this kind of policy is obvious, one person shouldn&rsquo;t be able to launch nuclear weapons on their own. Trustworthy is like having a two-man rule for your data.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>Trustworthy is implemented as a <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/trustworthy">ruby gem</a> with the source on <a href="https://github.com/jtdowney/trustworthy">GitHub</a>. When installed via ruby gems it creates a new command line utility named <code>trustworthy</code>.</p>
<p>Once you have installed trustworthy, the first step is to generate a new master key. This key is never stored anywhere on disk but is instead derived from at least two user keys.</p>
<pre><code>$ trustworthy init
Creating a new master key with 2 keys
Username: user1
Password:
Password (again):
Key user1 added
Username: user2
Password:
Password (again):
Key user2 added
Created trustworthy.yml
</code></pre>
<p>This command will generate the key in the background and then split it using <a href="#shamirs-secret-sharing-algorithm">Shamir&rsquo;s Secret Sharing Algorithm</a>. You can then use trustworthy to encrypt and decrypt files using this master key.</p>
<pre><code>$ trustworthy encrypt secret.txt
Username: user1
Password:
Unlocked user1
Username: user2
Password:
Unlocked user2
Reconstructed master key
Encrypted secret.txt to secret.txt.tw
</code></pre>
<p>Additional users can be added provided two current users unlock the master key to do so.</p>
<pre><code>$ trustworthy add-key
Adding a new key to master key
Username: user1
Password:
Unlocked user1
Username: user2
Password:
Unlocked user2
Reconstructed master key
Username: user3
Password:
Password (again):
Added user3
</code></pre>
<h2 id="shamirs-secret-sharing-algorithm">Shamir&rsquo;s Secret Sharing Algorithm</h2>
<p>The algorithm behind trustworthy is incredibly simple and requires nothing more than a high school understanding of algebra. Trustworthy uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir&rsquo;s Secret Sharing algorithm</a> to split a master key between two users. In general, Shamir&rsquo;s Secret Sharing algorithm uses a polynomial as the master key. Each user is given a unique point along that polynomial that can be used to reconstruct the master key at a later point. Trustworthy implements the most basic form of Shamir&rsquo;s Secret Sharing algorithm, polynomials of degree one.</p>
<p>If you think back to high school you might remember the slope intercept form <code>y = mx + b</code> which defines a line. The y-intercept, <code>b</code>, is used by trustworthy as the master key.</p>
<p><img src="/images/introducing-trustworthy-graph.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example, Alice is given the point <code>10, 21</code>, and Bob is given <code>40, 9</code>. By themselves, neither Alice nor Bob can figure out the y-intercept. However, once they come together, they can recompute the line and easily derive the y-intercept <code>40</code>. To protect the points along of the line, trustworthy encrypts the data using a user supplied password. At runtime the user provides the password so that the point can first be decrypted.</p>
